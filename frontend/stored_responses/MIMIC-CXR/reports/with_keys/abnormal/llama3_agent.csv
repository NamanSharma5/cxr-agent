10183775,Findings:

The chest X-ray shows:

* Cannot exclude Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
* Probable Cardiomegaly
* Possible Edema
* Cannot exclude Atelectasis

The Enlarged Cardiomediastinum is possibly located on both sides, with no confident lateral location.
10268877,Findings:

The chest X-ray reveals possible Lung Opacity. 

There is possible Edema, which is likely bilateral, as both left and right locations are reported. 

The report cannot exclude Cardiomegaly. 

The X-ray shows probable Pleural Effusion, with the effusion likely located on the left side, as the confidence score is higher for this location.
11052935,Findings:

* Cannot exclude Lung Opacity
* Possible Lung Lesion
* Possible Consolidation
* Probable Pneumonia
* Cannot exclude Atelectasis
* Probable Pneumothorax

Note: Lung Opacity is likely bilateral, given the presence of pathology detection on both sides.

The chest X-ray shows possible Lung Opacity, possible Consolidation, and probable Atelectasis. 

The Lung Opacity is likely bilateral, as it cannot be excluded. 

The Consolidation is also likely bilateral, as it cannot be excluded. 

The Atelectasis is likely bilateral, as it is present on both the left and right sides.
16049879,Findings:

The chest X-ray shows possible Enlarged Cardiomediastinum, possible Cardiomegaly, and possible Lung Opacity. Cannot exclude Edema. 

Enlarged Cardiomediastinum is likely bilateral, as it is detected with similar confidence scores on both the left and right sides.
