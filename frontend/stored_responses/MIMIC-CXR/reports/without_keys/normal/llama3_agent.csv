"Here is the findings section of the radiology report:

**FINDINGS:**

The chest X-ray shows a normal lung silhouette with no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening. The lungs are aeration is even and symmetric, with no visible consolidation, nodularity, or masses. The diaphragms are intact and at a normal level. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and shape. The trachea is midline and patent. The thoracic spine is aligned normally. No foreign bodies or tubes are visible. The lung fields are clear and free of any obvious abnormalities.","**Findings:**

The chest X-ray shows a normal radiographic appearance of the lungs, mediastinum, and diaphragm. The lungs are symmetrically inflated with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The vascular structures, including the aorta and pulmonary arteries, are normal in size and shape. The diaphragm is intact and at the expected level. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and shape. The bony thorax, including the ribs and sternum, is normal in appearance.","Findings:
