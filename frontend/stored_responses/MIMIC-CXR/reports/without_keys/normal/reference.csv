"     The lung volumes are normal. The patient is intubated. The tip of the  endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carinal. The course of the  nasogastric tube is unremarkable.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumonia, no  pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. ","     Low lung volumes on the AP projection causing crowding of bronchovascular  structures.  In addition, the apparent widened mediastinum is likely due to  patient positioning and rotation.  No focal consolidation concerning for  pneumonia.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar  silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.  No evidence of dispalced rib fractures.    IMPRESSION:     Low lung volumes causing crowding of bronchovascular structures.  No evidence  focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  No evidence of dispalced rib fractures.    Please see the subsequent CT torso report from the same date for further  findings. ","  No acute cardiopulmonary process. ","    No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. ","     The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.

IMPRESSION:  Left costophrenic angle not fully included on the image.   Otherwise, aside from top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, no  acute cardiopulmonary process seen. ","    Increased soft tissue thickening along the medial right upper mediastinum may  be related to patient rotation.  AP and lateral radiographs are recommended,  ensuring no patient rotation.

FINDINGS:    NG tube is in adequate position.  There is no pleural effusion or  pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear.  The mediastinal and cardiac contours are  normal.    CONCLUSION:    NG tube is in adequate position. ","     Portable supine chest film of ___ at 04:14 is submitted.    IMPRESSION:     Patient is status post median sternotomy with postoperative cardiac and  mediastinal contours. The aorta is somewhat unfolded and tortuous. Lung  volumes are low with faint opacities at both bases most likely representing  patchy atelectasis in this setting of low lung volumes.  No evidence of  pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. ",
