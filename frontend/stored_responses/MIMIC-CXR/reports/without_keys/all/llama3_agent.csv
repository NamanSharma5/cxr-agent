"Findings:

The chest X-ray shows:

* Cannot exclude Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
* Probable Cardiomegaly
* Possible Edema
* Cannot exclude Atelectasis

The Enlarged Cardiomediastinum is possibly located on both sides, with no confident lateral location.","Findings:

The chest X-ray reveals possible Lung Opacity. 

There is possible Edema, which is likely bilateral, as both left and right locations are reported. 

The report cannot exclude Cardiomegaly. 

The X-ray shows probable Pleural Effusion, with the effusion likely located on the left side, as the confidence score is higher for this location.","Findings:

* Cannot exclude Lung Opacity
* Possible Lung Lesion
* Possible Consolidation
* Probable Pneumonia
* Cannot exclude Atelectasis

The chest X-ray is normal. The lungs are aeration is even and bilateral, with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinum is within normal limits. The diaphragms are intact and at the expected level. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and shape. The ribs and bony thorax are normal. There is no evidence of pleural calcification or ossification. The lung fields are clear of any visible lung nodules or masses. The overall appearance of the chest X-ray is normal.","Findings:
Edema - cannot exclude","**FINDINGS**

The chest X-ray demonstrates a normal cardiac silhouette and mediastinum. The lungs are aeration is normal, with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The diaphragms are flat and parallel. The bony thorax is normal, with no evidence of fractures or osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions. The lung fields are clear of any visible pulmonary nodules or masses. The pleura is smooth and even. The trachea is midline. The soft tissues of the thorax are normal.","Findings:

The chest X-ray shows possible Lung Opacity, possible Consolidation, and probable Atelectasis. 

The Lung Opacity is likely bilateral, as it cannot be excluded.
