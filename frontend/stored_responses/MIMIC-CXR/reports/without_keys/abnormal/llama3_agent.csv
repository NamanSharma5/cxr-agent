"Findings:

The chest X-ray shows:

* Cannot exclude Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
* Probable Cardiomegaly
* Possible Edema
* Cannot exclude Atelectasis

The Enlarged Cardiomediastinum is possibly located on both sides, with no confident lateral location.","Findings:

The chest X-ray reveals possible Lung Opacity. 

There is possible Edema, which is likely bilateral, as both left and right locations are reported. 

The report cannot exclude Cardiomegaly. 

The X-ray shows probable Pleural Effusion, with the effusion likely located on the left side, as the confidence score is higher for this location.","Findings:

* Cannot exclude Lung Opacity
* Possible Lung Lesion
* Possible Consolidation
* Probable Pneumonia
* Cannot exclude Atelectasis
* Probable Pneumothorax

Note: Lung Opacity is likely bilateral, given the presence of pathology detection on both sides.","Findings:

* Cannot exclude Cardiomegaly
* Probable Lung Opacity
* Edema is present
* Cannot exclude Consolidation
* Probable Pleural Effusion
* Pleural Effusion is likely located on both sides","Findings:

* Cannot exclude Cardiomegaly
* Possible Lung Opacity
* Probable Edema
* Probable Atelectasis
* Possible Pleural Effusion","Findings:

* Cannot exclude Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
* Probable Cardiomegaly
* Possible Lung Opacity
* Possible Edema
* Enlarged Cardiomediastinum is likely bilateral","Findings:

* Lung Opacity: possible
* Edema: probable

* Atelectasis: probable","Findings:

Edema: cannot exclude
Consolidation: possible
Atelectasis: possible

Consolidation: possible, located on the left
Atelectasis: possible, located on both the left and right","Findings:

* Lung Opacity: possible
* Atelectasis: probable, bilateral","Findings:

The chest X-ray shows possible Lung Opacity. There is probable Atelectasis, which is bilateral. Cannot exclude Pleural Effusion.","Findings:
Edema - cannot exclude","Findings:

The chest X-ray shows possible Lung Opacity, possible Consolidation, and probable Atelectasis. 

The Lung Opacity is likely bilateral, as it cannot be excluded. 

The Consolidation is also likely bilateral, as it cannot be excluded. 

The Atelectasis is likely bilateral, as it is present on both the left and right sides.","Findings:

The chest X-ray shows possible Enlarged Cardiomediastinum, possible Cardiomegaly, and possible Lung Opacity. Cannot exclude Edema. 

Enlarged Cardiomediastinum is likely bilateral, as it is detected with similar confidence scores on both the left and right sides.","Findings:

* Cannot exclude Lung Opacity
* Possible Consolidation
* Probable Pleural Effusion","Findings:

Lung Opacity: cannot exclude
Consolidation: possible
Atelectasis: probable, bilateral
Pneumothorax: possible, bilateral
Pleural Effusion: probable, left","Findings:

The chest X-ray shows:

* Atelectasis: cannot exclude","Findings:

* Lung Opacity: cannot exclude
* Edema: possible
* Pleural Effusion: probable

Note: The lateral locations of these pathologies could not be confidently determined.","Findings:

* Possible Atelectasis
* Cannot exclude Cardiomegaly","Findings:
The chest X-ray shows possible Edema.","Findings:

* Cardiomegaly: possible
* Lung Opacity: probable
* Edema: probable
* Consolidation: cannot exclude
* Atelectasis: possible
* Pleural Effusion: probable","Findings:

The chest X-ray shows possible Lung Opacity. There is also possible Edema, which is likely bilateral. Additionally, the study cannot exclude Cardiomegaly.",
