 TECHNIQUE
 Portable view of the chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  There is increased opacity diffusely in the right
 greater than left lung.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle likely secondary to a pleural effusion.  Convexity of the
 main pulmonary artery contour or as well as widening of the right mediastinal

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, enlarged main pulmonary trunk, and diffuse right greater than
 left lung opacities, findings favor moderate to severe pulmonary edema.  Given
 asymmetry in lung opacity, pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Followup PA and
 lateral radiographs are recommended after diuresis to evaluate for underlying
 infection and to reassess mediastinal and hilar contours to help differentiate
 engorged vessels from lymphadenopathy he sought.

 atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region shows several air bronchograms. 
 The symmetry of the opacities is more suggestive of atelectasis than of
 pneumonia.  Nevertheless, a lateral radiograph should be obtained to better
 assess these changes.  No larger pleural effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly without
 overt pulmonary edema.

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The minor fissure is retracted, suggesting
 atelectasis in the right upper zone.  Minimal patchy opacity at both lung
 bases likely represents atelectasis, but an early aspiration pneumonia or
 other pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No frank
 consolidation or air bronchograms identified.  No gross effusion.  Apparent
 vascular plethora is likely an artifact of low inspiratory volumes.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is also prominent, but likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retraction of minor fissure suggests atelectasis in the right upper zone,
 of uncertain etiology.
 2. Probable atelectasis both lung bases, with low lung volumes.  Early
 infectious infiltrate or aspiration pneumonitis is considered less likely, but
 remains in the differential.
 3. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings,
 likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.
 4. Recommend repeat assessment after resolution of acute symptom with chest
 x-ray obtained with good inspiration, to better assess the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and lung bases and to assess for any persistence of the right upper
 zone atelectasis.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath postpartum.  Rule out
 heart failure or cardiomegaly.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes likely accentuate the vasculature as well as the
 heart size which on this AP film is top normal, but may be exaggerated due to
 the technique.  The lungs are clear of focal opacities concerning for
 infection.  No pleural effusion is present.  Again, the vasculature is
 accentuated which is likely due to low lung volumes, however, edema can be
 considered.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited AP view of the chest with low lung volumes, but no focal
 consolidations.  Possible edema.  Suggest a PA and lateral view of the chest
 if the patient can tolerate with better inspiratory effort to differentiate
 pathology versus normal findings.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Metastatic colon cancer, pneumonia, evaluation for pulmonary
 process.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is increased density at both lung
 apices, suggesting a preexisting fibrotic or chronic inflammatory disease. 
 The radiodensity of the lung parenchyma is slightly elevated, likely caused by
 soft tissue overlay and the low lung volumes.  No evidence of acute changes. 
 No clear visualization of nodules, although the interpretability of the image
 in this regard is low.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No larger
 pleural effusions.  If a reliable radiologic baseline examination is desired,
 a CT should be performed.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, contractures, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The patient is intubated, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina.  The patient also has a
 nasogastric tube.  The tip of this tube is at the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction, the tip should be advanced by approximately 5 to 10
 cm.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and increased vascular diameters indicate
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  In addition, there are rather extensive
 alveolar opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas and in the entire central
 portions of the right lung.  These might reflect additional pneumonia or
 aspiration.  Close radiographic monitoring is required.  There is no evidence
 of pleural effusions or of pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  NG tube is seen with tip in the fundus of the stomach and side port
 at the level of the GE junction.  ET tube is in appropriate position with tip
 3 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely
 represents atelectasis, however, may represent aspiration pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The right pleural surface is clear.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not fully imaged; however, no large pleural effusion
 seen.  No pneumothorax. Mildly enlarged heart is likely attributed to AP
 technique and supine positioning.  Mediastinal contour and hila are normal. 
 Medialization of aortic arch calcifications  without irregularity of the
 aortic knob contour or apical cap is of unclear significance.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Consider advancing NG tube 3 cm for better seating in the stomach.
 2.  ET tube in appropriate position.
 3.  Medialization of the aortic arch calcifications may be positional in
 nature; however, if clinical concern for aortic pathology further evaluation
 with CT may be helpful.
 4.  Left lower lobe linear opacity is likely atelectasis, however, may
 represent aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Influenza, pneumonia, right IJ.  Evaluate for
 endotracheal tube location.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.6 cm above the level of
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen on the image.  A right internal jugular
 catheter is seen terminating at the region of the brachiocephalic veins.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There are large bilateral airspace
 opacities, right greater than left.  Pleural effusion may also be present on
 the right.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, although the right aspect of
 the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the large right lung
 opacity.  On the right, opacity involved most of the right hemithorax aside
 from the right lung apex.  On the left, there is left mid-to-lower lung large
 area of consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  Nasogastric tube
 courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included in the

 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and valve replacement.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is present.  Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads
 terminating in the region of the right atrium and right ventricle.  Widening
 of the superior mediastinal contour is noted, which could be due to low lung
 volumes and the presence of mediastinal fat.  There is crowding of
 bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted. 
 Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no displaced fractures
 identified.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with abdominal pain, evaluate for free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single portable upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Port-A-Cath projects over the right chest with tip in the right atrium.  Lung
 volumes are extremely low.  A triangular density projecting over the left
 lower lung likely represents plate-like atelectasis.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density. Otherwise, there is no focal consolidation, large
 effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is probable cardiomegaly, with prominence of the left ventricle.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  There is upper zone redistribution, without
 overt CHF.  There is probable atelectasis at the left base.  The absence of a
 lateral view it is difficult to completely exclude a focal infiltrate at the
 left base.  Elsewhere, no focal infiltrate or consolidation is detected.  No
 right effusion is detected.  Doubt significant left effusion.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Probable cardiomegaly, with prominence of the left ventricle.
 2. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
 3. Atelectasis at the left base.  No definite focal infiltrate at the left
 base.  If clinically indicated, a lateral radiograph and/or comparison to
 prior radiographs could help to assess for subtle left base infiltrate.  This
 would also allow for better assessment of the left ventricular contour, which
 is somewhat atypical on these views.
 4. Otherwise, no focal opacities suggest pneumonia.  Comparison with any
 previous (outside) radiographs could help for further assessment.
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):
 1. No definite focal infiltrate at the left base. If clinically indicated, a
 lateral radiograph and/or comparison to prior radiographs could help to assess
 for subtle left base infiltrate. This would also allow for better assessment
 of the left ventricular contour, which is somewhat atypical on these views.
 2. Comparison with any previous (outside) radiographs could help for further

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old with hemoptysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is linear right basilar
 atelectasis/scarring.  Relative lucency of the upper lungs also suggests
 presence of pulmonary emphysema.  Skinfold is noted overlying the left upper
 hemithorax.  No pneumothorax is seen.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 aorta is calcified and tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. 
 There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD with likely pulmonary emphysema.  No definite focal
 consolidation.  Please note that bronchoscopy or CT is more sensitive for
 pulmonary/endobronchial lesions.

 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are mildly diminished.  Opacification in both lungs is
 heterogeneous.  It could be due to vascular engorgement edema, but concurrent
 abnormalities such as septic emboli or pneumonia would be difficult to
 exclude.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are bulging.
 This could be due to vascular engorgement and fat or adenopathy.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette
 which is likely top normal.  The mediastinal contour appears widened, likely
 due to low lung volumes, with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. 
 There is hazy opacification within both lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormalities are
 seen.

 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 A moderate right pneumothorax is obscured by heavy subcutaneous emphysema in
 the right chest wall extending into the neck and axilla; the mediastinum is
 not shifted, despite presumed postive pressure ventilation from an
 endotracheal tube ending 2 cm above the carina.  An esophageal tube ends at
 the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced at least 12cm to
 move all the sideports into the stomach that is currently massively distended
 with air, quite likely interfering with expansion of the chest.
 
 Both lungs are densely consolidated, the right lung diffusely and the left
 predominantly at the base; contributions from atelectasis, aspiration, edemas,
 and even hemorrhage, cannot be assigne. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. The
 mediastinum is not appreciably widened. Pleural effusions are presumed, but
 not appreciable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pneumothorax, explains subcutaneous emphysema. Has there
 been an attempted central line placement? Mediastinum is neither shifted nor
 widened.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial markings are noted, right greater than left. 
 Additionally, there is a right upper lobe opacity with mediastinal shift
 towards the right.  This is suggestive of underlying volume loss, possibly
 prior lobectomy changes.  However, if there is no history of surgery,
 underlying malignancy should be considered.  Superimposed post-obstructive

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 appears tortuous, but the aortic knob appears distinct.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum is likely due to technique and low inspiratory volumes. 
 No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or large
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple bilateral displaced rib fractures are noted
 involving at least ribs 4 through 8 on the left, and rib 4 on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acutely displaced bilateral rib fractures.  Low lung volumes
 result in widening of the superior mediastinum, however if there is concern
 for injury, a CTA of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.

 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating at the right atrium.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 right basal opacity suggests pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, 
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Small pulmonary nodules seen on
 prior CTs are better evaluated on CT.  There is slight prominence of the
 interstitium which may be due to minimal interstitial edema.  No left pleural
 effusion is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Right basal opacity may be due to combination
 of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if
 patient able.  Slight prominence of the interstitium bilaterally could be due
 to minimal interstitial edema.

 HISTORY:  Fall 6 feet onto concrete.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Superior
 mediastinum is widened, though this partially may be due to supine positioning
 and low inspiratory volumes.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is
 noted, but no pulmonary edema is seen.  Hazy rounded opacity is seen within
 the left mid lung field, which is nonspecific but could reflect an area of
 contusion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 present.  No displaced fractures are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and
 supine positioning.  However, if there is continued clinical concern for
 mediastinal injury, then a dedicated chest CTA is suggested.
 
 2. Nonspecific ill-defined opacity within the left mid lung field.  This could
 reflect an area of contusion.

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lung volumes are extremely low, with mild asymmetric elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  Opacity in the right lung base, likely represents
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. A small right pleural effusion is
 likely present. If there is concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series can
 be performed with a marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity is likely a combination of
 atelectasis/consolidation and effusion, but PA and lateral CXR may be helpful
 for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.

 INDICATION:  History: ___M with AMS  // ?pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiomegaly is moderate and limits assessment of the retrocardiac lungs.
 Prominence of the upper mediastinum is likely a combination of unfolding of
 the aorta and projection.  The hila are likely prominent with a tapered
 appearance raising the question of pulmonary hypertension.  There is pulmonary
 edema, with vascular plethora I interstitial and possible areas of alveolar
 edema.  More confluent opacity seen at the right lung base.  There is also row
 increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Allowing for positioning, no gross effusions identified.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Increased interstitial opacities at the lung
 bases bilaterally in the presence of mild cardiomegaly likely represent
 pulmonary edema. Given the lack of prior radiographs, this could however
 represent underlying interstitial abnormality.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 Soft tissue densities in the axilla bilaterally may represent adenopathy,
 however are not unusually appreciated by plain film. Correlation with physical
 exam is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffuse interstitial opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, in
 combination with mild cardiomegaly likely represent pulmonary edema.

 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment.  The lung volumes are low. 
 This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. 
 There is no mediastinal widening.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 is likely related to low lung volumes.  Mild atelectasis is noted within the
 lung bases.  No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified.  No displaced fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No acute traumatic injury
 identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  Mediastinal contours unremarkable.  There is mild pulmonary edema
 along with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Elevation the right
 hemidiaphragm is of unknown chronicity.  Patchy opacities in lung bases may
 reflect areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 patchy opacities, likely atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are relatively low lung volumes.  Large opacity projecting over the left
 mid to lower lung fields with subtle air bronchograms seen is worrisome for
 pneumonia.  No definite pleural effusion is seen, although small left pleural
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  The right lung is clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Large left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with episodic ___ weakness  // r/o infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are mildly enlarged.  The patient is after median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes are preserved.  Mild interstitial changes
 are noted bilaterally, potentially representing chronic changes but mild
 interstitial edema is a possibility.  No definitive focal consolidations to
 suggest infectious process demonstrated.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain status post MVA, question acute injuries.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph obtained.  Lungs are clear
 bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart
 and mediastinal contours are normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No
 displaced rib fractures are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute traumatic injuries.

Subject 19999376
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rectal trauma and bleeding.  Rule out free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.  
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs
 are well expanded and clear.  There is no large pleural effusion, pneumothorax
 or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  There is no evidence of free
 air.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No evidence of free air.
