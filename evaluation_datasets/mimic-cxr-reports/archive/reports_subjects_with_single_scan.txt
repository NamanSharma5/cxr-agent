 EXAM:  AP supine portable view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Transfer intubated, question ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ at 16:45.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Enteric tube seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port appears to
 be in the left upper quadrant in expected location of the stomach.  There is
 left base opacity which may represent combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis or underlying consolidation due to aspiration or contusion. 
 Additional left perihilar opacity is seen which may also relate to aspiration,
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, or infection.  There is slight blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion may be present.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.  The superior
 mediastinum remains widened although slightly less prominent as compared to
 this prior study and findings are likely accentuated by supine position in the
 AP technique.  However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal
 injury, CT is more sensitive.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Left base opacity may be combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis
 with also aspiration.  Additional opacity in the left lung may be due to
 additional areas of aspiration, although infection or contusion/pulmonary
 hemorrhage is not excluded within the appropriate clinical setting.
 3.  Possible trace right pleural effusion.
 4.  Prominence of the superior mediastinum likely accentuated by supine
 position and AP technique and appears slightly less prominent as compared to
 the prior study; however, if there is concern for acute mediastinal process,
 chest CT is more sensitive.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF with episode of unresponsiveness.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is huge enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette in a patient who has undergone previous CABG procedure and has
 intact midline sternal wires.  Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within
 normal limits.  Some ill-defined opacification at the right base suggests some
 atelectatic change.  The left base is difficult to assess due to the size of
 the heart, though the hemidiaphragm is quite sharply seen.
 
 Discordancy of heart size and vascular congestion raises the possibility of
 cardiomyopathy or possibly even pericardial effusion.

 board was acquired.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Trauma board obscures detail.  Lung volumes are markedly low.  The patient is
 rotated, which likely accounts for the apparent mediastinal widening, but this
 can be further evaluated on followup imaging.  The heart is likely upper
 limits of normal in size.  No focal airspace consolidation is appreciated.  No
 large effusions.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  No displaced rib fracture
 is appreciated.  However, if this is of clinical concern, a dedicated rib
 series may be helpful.

 HISTORY:  Post-cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about
 2.5 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube terminates near the inlet to the
 hemidiaphragm, probably in the distal esophagus.  A left internal central
 jugular venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava.  The heart
 appears mildly rounded and perhaps enlarged.  There is a pleural effusion on
 the left, probably small-to-moderate in size, with retrocardiac opacification,
 including air bronchograms, which is non-specific but often seen with
 atelectasis, although potentially aspiration or pneumonia could be considered.
 The right costophrenic angle is partly excluded, but visualized right lung
 fields appear clear.

 FINDINGS:  Diffuse airspace opacities in the right lower lobe are apparently
 new compared to the prior CT, and likely obscure underlying known ground-glass
 nodules in this region.  If the bronchoscopic procedure was performed in the
 right lung, this could be due to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  Alternatively,
 pulmonary hemorrhage, massive aspiration and infectious pneumonia are
 additional considerations for this appearance.  Lungs are otherwise remarkable
 for subtle multifocal poorly defined opacities which probably correspond to
 the known ground-glass nodules on CT.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.

 polytrauma, now hypoxic.  Evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 6:31 is submitted without comparisons.
 Comparison, however, is made to selected images from a chest CT dated
 ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax.  The airway
 does appear to be patent and therefore this likely represents lung collapse,
 although hemorrhage into the pleural space should also be considered.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax
 is diminished given supine technique.  Opacity overlying the right medial lung
 base may reflect middle lobe atelectasis as well.  No right effusion is seen. 
 Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is challenging as there is
 shift to the left consistent with the volume loss.  This can be better
 assessed on followup imaging.
 
 2. Endotracheal tube has its tip 6.5-7cm above the carina.  This should be
 advanced 2-3 cm.  The nasogastric tube has its side-port in the distal
 esophagus.  This tube should be advanced 9-10 cm so that the tip and side-port
 are in the stomach.  The esophageal probe has its tip at the level of the

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Arm edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  A two-lead pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right
 ventricle and coronary sinus is noted.  The heart appears normal in size. 
 Mild unfolding is noted along the thoracic aorta with calcification. 
 Heterogeneous opacification is noted along each lower lung.  Opacities are
 noted in both infrahilar regions, more extensive on the left than right. 
 Particularly striking is patchy mid and peripheral right lower lung opacities.
 It is difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion on the right given partial
 exclusion of the costophrenic sulcus.  Blunting of the left costophrenic
 sulcus may be due to a small effusion or chronic thickening. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Heterogeneous opacification of the mid-to-lower lungs including
 right mid lung opacity.  It may be valuable to compare to prior radiographs if
 available.  Possibly, this appearance may be due to pneumonia in the right
 lung , superimposed on background pulmonary architecture, but findings are
 potentially more chronic.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with seizure and agitation  // eval for pulmonary
 process
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  The minor fissure is retracted, suggesting
 atelectasis in the right upper zone.  Minimal patchy opacity at both lung
 bases likely represents atelectasis, but an early aspiration pneumonia or
 other pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  No frank
 consolidation or air bronchograms identified.  No gross effusion.  Apparent
 vascular plethora is likely an artifact of low inspiratory volumes.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is also prominent, but likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Retraction of minor fissure suggests atelectasis in the right upper zone,
 of uncertain etiology.
 2. Probable atelectasis both lung bases, with low lung volumes.  Early
 infectious infiltrate or aspiration pneumonitis is considered less likely, but
 remains in the differential.
 3. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings,
 likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes.
 4. Recommend repeat assessment after resolution of acute symptom with chest
 x-ray obtained with good inspiration, to better assess the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and lung bases and to assess for any persistence of the right upper
 zone atelectasis.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube
 terminates 3.4 cm above the carina.  An orogastric tube extends inferiorly out
 of the field of view.  Diffuse pulmonary opacities in the right lung are fine.
 Minimal residual left basilar atelectasis remains after correction of prior
 right mainstem intubation.  Cardiomegaly is moderate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Asymmetric right worse than left pulmonary opacities may represent aspiration
 or infection.

 HISTORY:  Stroke and vomiting.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  This accentuates the size of the cardiac
 silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous.  There is
 crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is likely present, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.  There may
 be a trace left pleural effusion.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more so
 on the right, likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration cannot be
 completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no acute
 osseous abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  Probable small left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular

 AP CHEST, 5:18 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Vagal nerve stimulator battery change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Low lung volumes explain bronchovascular crowding, but make it difficult to
 exclude mild interstitial edema.  It also is likely responsible for
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe simulating consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is exaggerated by
 low lung volume.  Electrode passes from the left low pectoral power pack to
 the left paraspinal neck.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes limit assessment of the lung bases. Patchy opacities at the
 lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis though infection cannot be
 excluded. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. Consider repeat PA and
 lateral views when the patient can take a deeper inspiration for improved
 assessment of the lung bases.

 demands, on bed rest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 very recumbent position.  Comparison is made with the portable supine chest
 examination ___ ___ performed in the department's emergency unit.  The
 heart size remains unchanged.  The appearance of the thoracic aorta is
 unremarkable.  Again high positioned diaphragms indicative of poor inspiratory
 effort during examination.  Crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature
 present.  In addition, one has the impression of a plethora of the pulmonary
 vessels without evidence of perivascular haze or pleural effusion.  This may
 be the result of patient's bed rest and post-trauma fluid treatment.  Local
 discrete parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified on this portable chest
 examination.  If possible have repeat exam with standard views in PA and
 lateral projection with patient in upright position. This would be optimal to
 evaluate for possible pneumonic infiltrates.  No pneumothorax is seen on this

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm and lateral border of the descending aorta is nonspecific and
 could reflect any of a combination of atelectasis, focal pneumonia or even a
 small effusion.  Right infrahilar opacity with slight indistinctness of the
 right heart border could reflect infection in the appropriate clinical
 scenario.  Apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be related to
 positioning and technique versus volume loss.  There is cardiomegaly, but no
 CHF.  Aortic calcifications are present.  No pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  Rib series from ___.
  
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous rib series, there is unchanged evidence
 of a relatively large consolidation, combined to a surrounding opacity and,
 likely, small pleural effusion, on the right.  The change would be consistent
 with known recent pneumonia.  The chest radiograph shows no visible rib
 fractures.  Taking into consideration an outside hospital CT from ___, a hyperlucency at the lateral aspects of the consolidation likely
 reflects a pleural air inclusion with an air-fluid level.  In addition, the
 central portions of the consolidation on the CT show an area of necrosis with
 air inclusions, potentially reflecting parenchymal necrosis or a developing
 lung abscess.  On the CT, the extent of the parenchymal opacities is larger
 than it appears on the chest x-ray.  Close radiographic monitoring is
 required.

 AP CHEST, 3:24 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with a
 chest CT ___:
 
 Original component of right suprahilar pneumonia (for which there was no
 precursor lesion in ___) is no worse, but there is new opacification at
 the periphery of the right mid lung which could be worsening pneumonia. 
 Conventional radiographs would be helpful in excluding a component of
 overlying soft tissue.  Vascular clips suggest extensive bilateral anterior
 chest wall surgery.
 
 An increase in both cardiac diameter and size of the at least moderate to
 large hiatus hernia could be due to supine and AP positioning, but there is
 new mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting increased intravascular volume
 or pressure.  Left lung is clear.  There is neither appreciable pleural
 effusion, nor evidence of pneumothorax.

 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. 
 There is somewhat increased opacification of the right costophrenic sulcus
 with elevation and flattening which may reflect scarring or atelectasis
 associated with a small persistent pleural effusion, but this appearance is
 unlikely to reflect an acute process.  To some extent, this opacification was
 present on the prior examination, although less prominent.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the left.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 A patchy focal opacity projecting over the right upper lobe suggests minor
 scarring which is unchanged.  An oval nodular focus projecting over the left
 lower lung probably is due to a nipple shadow.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No definite evidence of acute disease.  
 
 2.  Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus, more prominent, probably a

 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly improved over the prior exam, no definite
 consolidation or edema is noted.  Again seen is an ill-defined density which
 projects at the intersection of the anterior right third and posterior right
 seventh rib.  This remains of unclear etiology but is reassuring given that it
 again is situated over osseous structures.  The aorta remains markedly
 tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged even accounting for patient and
 technical factors.  Both findings are stable.  No definite effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic
 spine and in the right shoulder.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute pulmonary process.  Hypertensive cardiomediastinal
 configuration is again noted.  The density projecting over the lateral right
 hemithorax tracts with osseous structures and most likely is osseous in
 etiology although pulmonary nodules not entirely excluded.  Consider nonurgent
 workup with oblique and lordotic views versus CT.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  There is streaky left mid to lower lung
 opacification which suggests atelectasis.  This appearance blurs the left
 costophrenic sulcus, making it difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion. 
 There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.

 chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most
 such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is
 clinically warranted,  the location of any referrable focal findings  should
 be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT
 scanning.

 Areas opacity at the right lung base extending to the level of the hilum, of
 uncertain etiology.  Immediately above this there is a small amount of
 platelike atelectasis at the right base.   Sharply defined linear lucency  is
 seen at the right base, but the significance of this is unclear.  Doubt but
 cannot entirely exclude loculated hydro pneumothorax.
 
 There is mild prominence of vessels, but no CHF.
 
 The left lung and remaining portion of the right lung is grossly clear,
 without focal infiltrate or consolidation.  No gross left effusion.
 
 Elsewhere, no pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unusual appearance at the right base, opacification and obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm-- the etiology is uncertain, as this could relate to an elevated
 hemidiaphragm, atelectasis, consolidation, pleural fluid or a combination
 thereof.  Given the sharp interface between the diaphragm and right midzone
 lung, is difficult to completely exclude a hydro pneumothorax, though that
 remains unlikely.  A lateral chest x-ray would likely be helpful in better
 understanding the opacity at the right lung base.  If feasible, a lateral
 decubitus view may also be helpful.
 
 Otherwise, no CHF or gross effusion.

 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 The patient is after tracheostomy placement with the tip of tracheostomy being
 4.5 cm above the carina.  There is a pacemaker in the left hemithorax with its
 leads terminating in the expected location of right atrium and right
 ventricle.  The assessment of the cardiac silhouette demonstrates mild
 cardiomegaly.  There is also presence of the mediastinal shift to the left,
 most likely due to left lower lobe atelectasis, partially imaged.  Patient is
 in mild interstitial edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen as well. 
 Infectious process in the lung bases cannot be entirely excluded.  Followup
 after diuresis to assess the remaining opacities that might potentially
 worrisome for infection is recommended.

 HISTORY:  Altered mental, fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is limited due to low inspiratory lung volumes and patient rotation. 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.   Low lung volumes
 accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely borderline
 enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present. 
 There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary
 edema is noted.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect
 atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No
 acute osseous abnormality seen.  Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral
 joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study due to low lung volumes and patient rotation.  Probable
 bibasilar atelectasis, but would recommend repeat PA and lateral radiographs
 with improved inspiratory effort when the patient is able to for further
 assessment of the lung bases.

 PORTABLE CHEST
 
 There is extensive pleural thickening and calcification involving the right
 lower hemithorax, with associated volume loss and increased opacity of the
 right lung.  There are additional extensive pericardial calcifications.  There
 is a possible parenchymal opacity at the right lung base, though it is unclear
 whether this represents additional pleural abnormality or more likely
 associated atelectasis.  The right upper lung zone and left lung remain clear.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged
 and there is widening of the mediastinal contours, incompletely evaluated
 though likely reflecting adenopathy seen on chest CT.  There is no pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Extensive pleural thickening and pleural calcification in the right
 hemithorax with associated volume loss and pericardial calcification, as seen
 on prior chest CT, most likely the sequelae of prior pleuropericarditis.
 
 2.  Added opacity at the right lung base, which could represent additional

 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and
 bronchovascular structures.  Calcified lymph nodes are present in the right
 hilar region as well as a calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe.  Patchy
 opacity in left retrocardiac region is new, and may reflects patchy
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Acute aspiration is an
 additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.  Note is also
 made of apparent rightward deviation of the trachea, at the level of the
 thoracic inlet.  This is difficult to evaluate on a portable radiograph,
 particularly as the patient's neck appears to be turned towards the right on
 this exam.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Apparent rightward deviation of trachea. Repeat radiograph with
 the neck in neutral position may be helpful to differentiate the effects of
 rotation from tracheal displacement from a fixed abnormality such as an
 adjacent thyroid mass.

 There is minimal increased right basilar opacity, potentially due to
 atelectasis given relatively lower lung volumes.  Left lung remains clear. 
 Lateral costophrenic angles are sharp.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
 as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slightly increased right basilar opacity, potentially due to
 atelectasis; however, PA and lateral may offer additional detail if desired. 
 Otherwise, unremarkable portable chest x-ray.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated in ___ at 00:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 hours prior, there is been
 interval placement of a left-sided IJ central venous catheter which terminates
 near the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  An enteric tube
 terminates within the gastric body.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis, although there is some asymmetry with increased opacification at
 the left base and a small pleural effusion, possibly suggesting the presence
 of a pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly is mildly increased, but without pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes
 are otherwise normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A left-sided central venous catheter terminates at the junction of the SVC and
 left brachiocephalic vein.  Minimally increased bibasilar atelectasis or
 alternatively a developing pneumonia.

 AP CHEST, 9:34 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after a C-section complicated by infected
 hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Lung volumes are low generally and greater opacification in the infrahilar
 left lower lung is at least atelectasis, should be followed to exclude the
 development of pneumonia.  Heart size is physiologic given recent pregnancy,
 low lung volumes and AP radiographic technique.  There is no pulmonary edema
 or any appreciable pleural effusion.  ET tube tip is at the upper margin of
 the clavicles, acceptably positioned 4.5 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 would need to be advanced at least 12 cm to move all the side ports into the
 distended stomach.  Dr. ___ was notified by Dr. ___ at 12:05 a.m.

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lung volumes are somewhat low however the
 lungs are clear except for apparent asymmetrical increased opacity in right
 retrocardiac region compared to the left, difficult to assess on this single
 projection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Questionable asymmetrical opacification in right
 retrocardiac region. Consider repeat PA and lateral films for further
 evaluation if clinically indicated to exclude a pneumonia in this region.

 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with lower lobe
 consolidation, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia, is seen. The left
 heart border is obscured by this process.  A small right pleural effusion is
 also seen. Indistinctness of the hilar markings is indicative of pulmonary
 edema.  The upper mediastinal contour appears within normal range for size.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with large left and small right pleural effusions
 is concerning for heart failure. Post diuresis films to exclude underlying LLL
 pneumonia is recommended.

 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given
 portable technique.  There is calcification of the aortic knob consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  In addition, there are some unusual calcifications
 projecting over two of the mid thoracic vertebrae which could reflect
 ascending aortic calcifications, calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, or
 possibly sclerotic vertebrae.  Correlation with a lateral film would be
 helpful.  A 5-mm calcified nodule is seen in the left costophrenic angle,
 likely representing a calcified granuloma.  Lung volumes are relatively low
 without evidence of pulmonary edema, focal airspace consolidation, pleural
 effusions, or pneumothorax.  Clips are seen overlying the right axilla,
 suggesting prior lymph node dissection.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 A right-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle. 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD. Relative paucity of
 vessels in both apices likely reflects emphsematous changes related to
 background emphysema. The pulmonary hila are prominent, with a tapered
 appearance, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. 
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The aorta is unfolded.   
 
 There is patchy opacity throughout the mid and lower zones of the left lung,
 with additional retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and a small left effusion, with obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is minimal patchy opacity in the right perihilar region.
 No right-sided effusion.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and possible pneumonia.  Question
 pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Because the patient is large, radiographic interrogation is difficult.  There
 is greater opacity in the right lower hemithorax than the left.  This could be
 consolidation, but it could also be explained by atelectasis and a posteriorly
 collected pleural effusion.  Heart is moderately enlarged, mediastinum is
 widened in part due to fat deposition, but an azygos fissure displays the
 azygos vein which is distended indicating elevated central venous pressure or
 volume, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular engorgement.  If there is any
 left pleural effusion, it is small.  Cardiomegaly is moderate, but exaggerated
 by what may well be non-erect positioning.  No pneumothorax.

 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  Lung markings are coarse with irregular
 architecture, suggestive of underlying lung disease.  This appearance could be
 seen with obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease or a
 mixture of both.  The prominence of the interstitium makes it difficult to
 exclude more acute etiologies, however, such as mild vascular congestion,
 airway inflammation or atypical infection.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion.  Diaphragms are flattened, however, so subpulmonic effusions are not
 excluded, although the finding may relate to hyperinflation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coarse irregular lung architecture suggesting underlying lung
 disease.  No definite superimposed process, but vascular congestion, airway
 inflammation or atypical infection may be involved with this appearance.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is a vague suggestion of
 some increased opacification at the left base.  However, this could reflect a
 prominent fat pad with mild atelectatic changes in a patient with substantial
 scattered radiation related to the his size.  If clinically possible, a
 lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation.  
 
 Two central catheters are in place, though the tips are poorly seen on the
 single view presented.  They both appear to be in the lower SVC.

 INDICATION:  Strokes, dysphagia, possibly aspiration.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Calcified valvular annulus.  Densities of calcific nature are
 seen at both hilar regions, right more than left and likely reflect calcified
 lymph nodes.  There is minimal increase in density in the lung apices, right

 difficile, hypoxic, with abdominal pain.  Evaluate for evidence of pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph from ___ as well as CT scans from ___ and ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Poor positioning and lung hypoinflation causing vascular crowding
 limit radiographic assessment. Allowing for these limitations, ill-defined
 opacities are noted in both lung bases. In the right these opcities are
 superimposed to areas of costochondral calcification making assessment
 difficult. A band-like opacity is noted transversing the right apex vertically
 with some surgical clips projecting over this opacity, which is unchanged
 compared with prior exam and likely represents a band of pulmonary scarring or
 pleural thickening. No other focal opacities are seen.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater than left.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 not significantly changed compared with prior study.  The aorta is tortuous
 and calcifications are again seen in the aortic knob.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  
 
 Sternotomy wires are intact. Clips from CABG are noted.  A right-sided mid
 line catheter is noted ending approximately at the level of the right
 shoulder. Severe degenerative changes of the right shoulder are chronic as
 well as a prosthetic left shoulder.

 small bilateral pleural effusions might represent atelectasis, though an

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status, contractures, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  The patient is intubated, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina.  The patient also has a
 nasogastric tube.  The tip of this tube is at the level of the
 gastroesophageal junction, the tip should be advanced by approximately 5 to 10
 cm.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and increased vascular diameters indicate
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  In addition, there are rather extensive
 alveolar opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas and in the entire central
 portions of the right lung.  These might reflect additional pneumonia or
 aspiration.  Close radiographic monitoring is required.  There is no evidence
 of pleural effusions or of pneumothorax.

 Supine positioning and very low lung volumes account in part for apparent
 increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette, but clinical consideration
 should be given to the possibility of any developing pericardial fluid
 collection. There is no venous engorgement in the mediastinum to suggest that
 pericardial fluid if present is hemodynamically significant.

 COMPARISONS:  Reference radiograph from___ from 4 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Prominence of the
 right heart and mediastinum may reflect an enlarged aorta.  Increased
 interstitial opacity in the lungs may reflect chronic pulmonary disease
 without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Mild vascular
 congestion is seen, without overt edema.  Mid right clavicular fracture is
 seen without evidence of additional bony injury, though if specific symptoms,
 dedicated rib views may be of help.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal with a
 rounded retrocardiac opacity reflecting a moderate hiatal 
 hernia.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  
 
 Rotated positioning.  As before, there is cardiomegaly.  Direct comparison for
 any increase in cardiac size is difficult due to rotated positioning and
 technical differences.  The possibility of some interval increase in the
 degree of cardiac enlargement cannot be excluded.  As before, as well, the
 aorta is calcified and unfolded.   There is a possible small right effusion as
 well as some atelectasis and scarring at the right base superimposed on a
 known elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Possibility of some interval worsening of
 these findings cannot be excluded.  There is new increased retrocardiac
 density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  No gross left effusion. Left apical
 pleural thickening is more apparent on the current film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Allowing for technical differences, there is new left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation and possible new opacity at the right base, with
 equivocal small right effusion.    Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia
 and aspiration.  Possibility of some degree of CHF superimposed on existing
 background COPD would also be difficult to exclude.

 FINDINGS:  NG tube is seen with tip in the fundus of the stomach and side port
 at the level of the GE junction.  ET tube is in appropriate position with tip
 3 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 The lungs are well expanded.  Linear opacity in the left lower lobe likely
 represents atelectasis, however, may represent aspiration pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The right pleural surface is clear.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not fully imaged; however, no large pleural effusion
 seen.  No pneumothorax. Mildly enlarged heart is likely attributed to AP
 technique and supine positioning.  Mediastinal contour and hila are normal. 
 Medialization of aortic arch calcifications  without irregularity of the
 aortic knob contour or apical cap is of unclear significance.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Consider advancing NG tube 3 cm for better seating in the stomach.
 2.  ET tube in appropriate position.
 3.  Medialization of the aortic arch calcifications may be positional in
 nature; however, if clinical concern for aortic pathology further evaluation
 with CT may be helpful.
 4.  Left lower lobe linear opacity is likely atelectasis, however, may
 represent aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.

 In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes
 that accentuate the prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Some engorgement of
 pulmonary vessels could reflect the recent pregnancy rather than definite
 pulmonary edema. Some prominence in the azygos region and central vessels
 could be a manifestation of increased pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 There is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor
 definition of the medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm. This probably
 represents atelectatic changes, though in the appropriate clinical setting
 aspiration could be considered.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal AP upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The
 examination is suboptimal due to poor penetration and patient body habitus. 
 Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding.  The
 lungs are grossly clear aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no
 large effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unchanged allowing for differences in technique.  Apparent widening of the

 atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Additionally,
 left base opacity may be due to atelectasis, infection or aspiration.  The
 cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
 Partially imaged is cervical spine hardware.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes.  Small right pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis,
 right basilar opacity may represent combination of the above, although
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Patchy left base retrocardiac
 opacity, atelectasis versus infection or aspiration.
 
 2.  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement, may be accentuated by low lung
 volumes.  Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views when/if patient able.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with fall, delirium, rales at bases,
 evaluate for acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semiupright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding chest examination which was dated ___.  The
 indication for the almost ___-year-old preceding examination was similar in as
 much the patient had experienced a fall and acute injuries were questioned at
 the emergency room examination.  The present portable chest examination shows
 similar findings in as much as the heart size is borderline and the thoracic
 aorta is moderately elongated and widened with calcium deposits in the wall. 
 There is, however, no suspicious local contour abnormality.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is not congested.  In comparison with the next previous
 examination, however, the left base is somewhat poorly ventilated with crowded
 vasculature and mildly elevated left-sided diaphragm.  The left lateral
 pleural sinus; however, is free and thus there is no evidence of pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The general appearance of some irregular
 vascular peripheral distribution is suggestive of COPD.  No pneumothorax in
 the apical area.  Unchanged appearance of a left-sided shoulder arthrodesis
 with metallic humeral head prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possibly beginning infiltrate on the left lung base.  Otherwise,
 no acute infiltrates or marked CHF on this portable chest examination. 
 Followup study is recommended.  Page to Dr. ___ was placed at 3:40 p.m.

Subject 15992400
                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Large pelvic mass and worsening leukocytosis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable.  The bilateral pleural
 effusions are large, associated with bibasal consolidation.  There is most
 likely no evidence of pulmonary edema and the ground-glass opacities
 throughout the lungs is due to layering pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 Potential of pneumonia obscured by atelectasis and pleural effusion is real
 and thus close monitoring with chest radiographs is recommended.

 FINDINGS:  Supraglottic airway is not well demonstrated due to flexed position
 of the patient's neck.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits
 except for apparent slight obscuration of lower right heart border.  This may
 simply be due to a prominent pericardial fat pad accentuated by patient
 rotation, but attention to this region on standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs would be helpful when the patient's condition permits, in order to
 exclude a localized right middle lobe process.  Lungs are otherwise clear.

 is projecting over the expected location of gastroesophageal junction.
 Correlation with barium swallowing may be beneficial for precise determination
 of the position of the stent.  Alternatively, CT chest could be obtained as

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with ACOM aneurysm, now with decreased
 oxygen saturation.  Chest examination to rule out congestion or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  There is moderate cardiac enlargement.  No typical
 configurational abnormality can be identified; however, a relative elevation
 of the cardiac apex is noted.  A left-sided permanent pacer in axillary
 position is connected to two intravascular electrodes terminating in right
 atrial appendage and apical portion of right ventricle correspondingly.  A
 mild prominence in the mid portion of the left cardiac contour suggests some
 enlargement of the left atrium.  Most striking is the evidence of a rounded
 vascular density to the right of the trachea and most likely representing a
 right-sided aortic arch.  The trachea deviates mildly towards the left
 supporting such diagnosis.  The superior mediastinum, however, is moderately
 widened in addition and other vascular abnormalities cannot be excluded on
 this single chest view.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature does not give the impression of congestion.
 
 Our records include now also a chest examination dated ___ and
 transferred from an outside hospital.  Findings are similar and support
 suspicion for a right-sided aortic arch abnormality.  Further evaluation of
 possible vascular abnormalities by CT or MR is recommended.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.6 cm above the carina,
 tube is well positioned.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.  The previously placed right subclavian line has been removed. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen.  The
 opacities are dependent and combined to widening of the mediastinum and
 increase in diameter of the pulmonary vessels.  Overall, these findings
 suggest moderate pulmonary edema.  The presence of small pleural effusion
 might not be excluded.  The displayed parts of the stomach are overinflated,
 so that placement of a nasogastric tube might be considered.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with hemorrhagic cystitis, status post
 blood transfusions with worsening cough and basilar crackles.  Question: ?
 pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and
 lateral chest examination of ___.  Heart size in comparison made
 on the frontal views has not significantly changed, thus cardiogenic pulmonary
 edema is unlikely.  There are new bilateral hazy densities on the lung bases,
 more marked on the left side where the diaphragmatic contour is completely
 obliterated.  This is related to a pleural effusion which also blunts the
 lateral pleural sinus.  The right-sided pleural sinus remains free, but the
 hazy density is similar to that on the left side, probably represents smaller
 amount of pleural effusion layering in the posterior compartment of the
 pleural space with the patient in recumbent position.  There is no evidence of
 new acute parenchymal infiltrates, and the pulmonary vasculature does not show
 any congestive pattern.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, the patient is substantially
 rotated to the left.  Additionally, lower lung volumes result an accentuation
 of the cardiomediastinal contours and crowding of bronchovascular structures. 
 New linear opacities in the right perihilar and left basilar region are

 1.  Left lung is grossly clear with the exception of linear opacities at the
 left base which likely reflect scarring.  The right hemidiaphragm is elevated,
 of uncertain significance, and the right costophrenic angle is not entirely
 included on the study.  There is patchy opacity at the right base which could
 reflect compressive atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  Interval removal of the right Port-A-Cath. 
 No pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  Chest pain, to assess for pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the outside study of ___, there is little
 overall change.  There are atelectatic streaks especially at the left base,
 but no evidence of appreciable cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, pleural
 effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.  Midline sternal wires are intact.  A
 linear opacification at the left base medially most likely represents an
 unchanged surgical clips.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for
 comparison.  
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or
 slightly enlarged.  There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence
 of CHF.  There is some patchy opacity at the left greater than right bases,
 presumably representing atelectasis.  There is tenting of the right
 hemidiaphragm medially -- this is also likely related to atelectasis.  No
 gross effusion is identified.  
 
 If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to better characterize the
 opacities at both bases.

 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  There are
 widespread left greater than right opacities compatible with pulmonary edema
 which is exaggerated by extremely low lung volumes and concurrent left lung
 base atelectasis.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is
 in place, 4 cm cranial to the carina in standard position.  A right internal
 jugular approach central venous catheter terminates at the distal SVC.  An
 upper enteric tube is in place in the distal stomach out of view of imaging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary edema. Support devices in
 standard positioning.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:14.  
 
 ET tube is present in satisfactory position approximately 3.3 cm above the
 carina.  It has been retracted compared with the initial chest x-ray.  An NG
 tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm.  Side port overlying upper stomach and
 distal tip below the edge of this film. 
 
 Rotated positioning.  Extreme lateral portion of the lower right chest wall is
 excluded from the film.  
 
 Leftward positioning of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably related
 to rotation, but could reflect slight volume loss in the left chest.  The
 appearance is grossly unchanged.  The opacity at the left base is again noted,
 unchanged.  No CHF, new consolidation, or gross effusion.   No supine film
 evidence of pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Incidental note is made of contrast in non-dilated renal collecting systems
 s/p interval chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval repositioning of ET tube, now in satisfactory position.  
 2) Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Hazy retrocardiac opacity
 and possible leftward shift of the mediastinum are unchanged.  Please see
 comment above.

 PORTABLE CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Abnormal breath sounds, please evaluate for possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Chest radiographs in ___ showed mild pulmonary edema and a large region
 of heterogeneous consolidation in the left upper lobe, either cavitary
 pneumonia or pneumonia in the setting of bullous emphysema.  That region has
 not cleared.  There is new opacification in the right mid lung marginated by
 the minor fissure, quite likely a second focus of infection.  Additional
 imaging workup is needed, and should evaluate the possibility of intrathoracic
 malignancy, particularly since today's examination suggests the development of
 many small nodules in the right lower lung.  Heart size is normal. 
 Interstitial pulmonary edema is mild, improved from prior examinations.

 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:16 PM
  Lungs are low in volume which limits assessment and gives the appearance of
  bronchovascular crowding. Within this limitation, the presence of mild edema
  is difficult to determine. 
  
  LLL/retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis given low lung volumes, however
  accompanying trace effusion cannot be excluded. For more complete evaluation,
  2 view chest radiograph with full inspiration is recommended.

 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 A moderate right pneumothorax is obscured by heavy subcutaneous emphysema in
 the right chest wall extending into the neck and axilla; the mediastinum is
 not shifted, despite presumed postive pressure ventilation from an
 endotracheal tube ending 2 cm above the carina.  An esophageal tube ends at
 the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced at least 12cm to
 move all the sideports into the stomach that is currently massively distended
 with air, quite likely interfering with expansion of the chest.
 
 Both lungs are densely consolidated, the right lung diffusely and the left
 predominantly at the base; contributions from atelectasis, aspiration, edemas,
 and even hemorrhage, cannot be assigne. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. The
 mediastinum is not appreciably widened. Pleural effusions are presumed, but
 not appreciable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Moderate right pneumothorax, explains subcutaneous emphysema. Has there
 been an attempted central line placement? Mediastinum is neither shifted nor
 widened.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  There are streaky right basilar opacities, more
 suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia.  Minimal blunting at the left
 costophrenic sulcus is of uncertain significance, but differential
 considerations include a tiny pleural effusion versus scarring.  Projecting
 over the left lateral lung apex near an EKG lead is a small nodular focus of
 uncertain significance, less than 10 mm in size.  A subpleural scarring is
 noted at each lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy right basilar opacity, typical for atelectasis.  If pulmonary
 symptoms or present or persist, howver, short-term followup radiographs could
 be considered to re-evaluate the opacity, preferably with PA and lateral
 technique, if possible clinically.
 
 2.  Nodular focus projecting over the left lung apex, near an EKG lead. 
 Although likely an artifact, it is difficult to exclude a true pulmonary
 nodule, and accordingly re-assessment with standard PA and lateral radiographs
 is recommended, following removal of the EKG leads, when clinically
 appropriate.

 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a past medical history of severe COPD, now
 presenting with worsening dyspnea over the past few days.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffuse interstitial markings are noted, right greater than left. 
 Additionally, there is a right upper lobe opacity with mediastinal shift
 towards the right.  This is suggestive of underlying volume loss, possibly
 prior lobectomy changes.  However, if there is no history of surgery,
 underlying malignancy should be considered.  Superimposed post-obstructive
 pneumonia is possible.
 
 Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base.  No substantial pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe opacity and volume loss.  While this may reflect prior
 lobectomy change, there may be an underlying mass with possible
 post-obstructive pneumonia, and should be further investigated with CT.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT with contrast for further evaluation of rightward
 mediastinal shift and right upper lobe opacity.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again noted is a large hiatal hernia.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Streaky opacifications in the left inferior hilar
 region were present before to some extent and can be expected as chronic
 atelectasis is often seen in association with a large hiatal hernia.  However,
 it appears more prominent than before and the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia could be considered.  There is probably a trace pleural effusion on
 the left.  A very small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased left basilar opacity.  The appearance and location are fairly
 typical for atelectasis that is usually seen in conjunction with a large
 hiatal hernia, although superimposed pneumonia is a possibility to consider.

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  The aorta
 appears tortuous, but the aortic knob appears distinct.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum is likely due to technique and low inspiratory volumes. 
 No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or large
 pneumothorax is present.  Multiple bilateral displaced rib fractures are noted
 involving at least ribs 4 through 8 on the left, and rib 4 on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Acutely displaced bilateral rib fractures.  Low lung volumes
 result in widening of the superior mediastinum, however if there is concern
 for injury, a CTA of the chest is recommended for further evaluation.

 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size
 appearing top normal.  Focal contour abnormality at the level of the aortic
 arch corresponds to the known pseudoaneurysm which was better depicted on the
 previous CT.  Calcified hilar lymph nodes are re- demonstrated. Architectural
 distortion with traction bronchiectasis and fibrotic changes are noted in both
 upper lobes, right greater than left, likely related to prior granulomatous
 infection.  Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe peripherally was present on
 the prior CT, and again may reflect an area of infection.  Patchy retrocardiac
 opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded, and there are
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic changes with architectural distortion most pronounced in the upper
 lobes compatible with prior granulomatous disease.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, unchanged.  Right basilar patchy opacity was seen on the recent
 chest CT, and may reflect an area of infection.  Retrocardiac opacity could
 reflect atelectasis though infection is also not excluded.

 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new O2 requirement.  ? Volume overload.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No prior studies are available for comparison.  There is mild cardiomegaly,
 likely accentuated by the AP projection and low lung volumes.  Opacification
 in the medial right lower lobe is of unclear etiology, but may be due to a
 prominent epicardial fat pad, cardiac enlargement, a pericardial cyst, or
 hernia.  No large focal consolidation.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Incidental note is made of old fractures of the posterior left fourth and
 fifth ribs, with bony callus.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Opacity in the medial right lower lung is of unclear etiology of the may
 be due to cardiomegaly, a prominent epicardial fat pad, pericardial cyst, or
 possibly a hernia.  Correlation with old films, if obtainable, is recommended.
 
 2.  No large focal consolidation.

 Of note, there is a rounded opacity projecting immediately to the left of the
 expected location of the left hilum.  This could relate to a parenchymal
 opacity, but the configuration is concerning for pulmonary artery enlargement,
 pulmonary artery aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, or mass related to the left hilum. 
 This is in keeping with findings on the ___ 18:36 p.m. chest CT, albeit a
 limited CT study due to the absence of IV contrast.  
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring,
 suggesting mild CHF.  Possible trace right-sided pleural fluid.  No focal
 infiltrate identified on the right.  
 
 Upper abdominal surgical ___ noted.  No pneumothorax detected.  
 
 Incidental note made of surgical anchors overlying the right humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 2.  Probable mild CHF.
 3.  Opacity adjacent to the left hilum -- the appearance raises the question
 of left pulmonary artery enlargement, aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, or left  hilar
 mass. Please see comment above.

 INDICATION:  Exploratory laparotomy, evaluation of lung changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are relatively low.  There is a minimal increase
 in radiodensity over the right basal hemithorax.  This could be positional or
 caused by a minimal right pleural effusion.  However, it is impossible to
 evaluate this suspicion without a lateral radiograph.
 
 Otherwise, the radiograph is unremarkable.  Minimal atelectasis in the left
 perihilar areas.  Low lung volumes and borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette without pulmonary edema.  No free subdiaphragmatic air.

 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph is available for comparison.  Reference
 made to CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  A
 right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating at the right atrium.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 right basal opacity suggests pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, 
 underlying consolidation is not excluded.  Small pulmonary nodules seen on
 prior CTs are better evaluated on CT.  There is slight prominence of the
 interstitium which may be due to minimal interstitial edema.  No left pleural
 effusion is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contour is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  Right basal opacity may be due to combination
 of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. 
 Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if
 patient able.  Slight prominence of the interstitium bilaterally could be due
 to minimal interstitial edema.

 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right-sided pacer remains in place with leads terminating over the expected
 location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively.  There is
 worsening bilateral airspace and perihilar vascular congestion, consistent
 with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  There are increasing bilateral
 layering effusions.  Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive
 atelectasis.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged
 given differences in positioning.  Several of the superior sternal wires are
 fractured, but unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Severe degenerative
 changes are seen of an incompletely visualized left glenohumeral joint, where
 there is also flattening of the humeral head which may represent a component
 of avascular necrosis.  Clinical correlation is advised.

 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  No radiopaque foreign body is identified in the imaged portion of
 the chest or upper abdomen to suggest an ingestion of swallowed dentures. 
 However, only the uppermost portion of the abdomen was included on the study,
 and dedicated abdominal radiograph may be helpful if there is concern for
 foreign body in the large or small bowel.  In the imaged portion of the neck,
 two partially imaged cylindrical radiodense foreign bodies are evident,
 overlying the inferior aspect of the mandible, and may potentially be related
 to dental hardware, cervical spine hardware, or a structure external to the
 patient.  Dedicated neck imaging could clarify the location if it remains
 unknown clinically.
 
 Within the imaged portion of the chest, an asymmetrical 1.6 cm diameter
 opacity is seen at the right apex above the level of the right clavicle
 overlying the fourth posterior rib level.  On the single view, it is uncertain
 whether this is a lung nodule or an abnormality of the rib.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal
 interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right apical nodular opacity which may be related to a rib or lung
 abnormality.  Further evaluation could be performed either with an apical
 lordotic chest radiograph or CT scan, as communicated to Dr. ___ by
 telephone at 8:05 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
 2.  Cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.

 COMPARISON:  Chest CTA ___ at 10:00
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Apparent
 enlargement of the left hilum is likely due to mild enlargement of the left
 lower lobe pulmonary artery due to pulmonary embolism as demonstrated on CT.
 Focal opacity within the left lower lobe is compatible with infarction.
 Streaky opacity in the right lower lobe may reflect an additional site of
 developing infarction or atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is noted. No
 pneumothorax is identified. Mild degenerative changes are present in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Apparent left hilar enlargement likely reflects mild enlargement of the

 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Superior
 mediastinum is widened, though this partially may be due to supine positioning
 and low inspiratory volumes.  Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 normal.  The lung volumes are extremely low, with mild asymmetric elevation of
 the right hemidiaphragm.  Opacity in the right lung base, likely represents
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is seen. A small right pleural effusion is
 likely present. If there is concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series can
 be performed with a marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity is likely a combination of
 atelectasis/consolidation and effusion, but PA and lateral CXR may be helpful
 for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.

 HISTORY:  Multiple CVAs, now with large L3-L4 disc herniation.  Preoperative
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are increased opacities in the perihilar distribution
 bilaterally but particularly on the right side.  In this area, there is also
 evidence of peribronchial cuffing, but whether this is within the bronchus or
 around the bronchus is uncertain.  This constellation of findings could be
 seen in cardiac failure and pulmonary edema process leading towards infection
 such as viral pneumonia is not ruled out.  There is minimal left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There are no pleural effusions.  The cardiac size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Perihilar opacities, right greater than left, along with
 peribronchial cuffing.  Pulmonary edema versus an infectious process such as
 viral pneumonia are considerations.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Increased interstitial opacities at the lung
 bases bilaterally in the presence of mild cardiomegaly likely represent
 pulmonary edema. Given the lack of prior radiographs, this could however
 represent underlying interstitial abnormality.  There is no pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 Soft tissue densities in the axilla bilaterally may represent adenopathy,
 however are not unusually appreciated by plain film. Correlation with physical
 exam is recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffuse interstitial opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, in
 combination with mild cardiomegaly likely represent pulmonary edema.
 2. Dedicated PA and lateral radiographs are recommended for better evaluation.
 3. Soft tissue densities in the axilla bilaterally may represent adenopathy,
 and they should be correlated with physical exam.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates a Swan-Ganz
 catheter which is far past midline into likely segmental right pulmonary
 artery.  It should be retracted by at least 6-7 cm for more appropriate
 positioning in the proximal pulmonary artery.  As compared to prior study, the
 lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac contour.  The heart and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  Diffuse right lung opacities are slightly
 improved with worsened opacification of the left lung, likely equilibrating
 pulmonary edema.  No pleural abnormality is seen.

 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright view of the chest provided.  The patient is
 slightly rotated to the left.  There is increased opacity in the right lung
 base which is concerning for pneumonia.  In addition, there is retrocardiac
 opacity, mostly in a linear configuration, which could represent atelectasis,
 less likely pneumonia/aspiration.  A few scattered more nodular-appearing
 opacities are seen in the mid-to-upper lungs, at least one of which likely
 represents an EKG related to sternal artifact.  No pneumothorax is seen.  No
 large effusion.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the right lung base concerning for pneumonia. 
 Presumed retrocardiac atelectasis.  Additional nodular opacities in the right

 Rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 3.4 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. 
 Additional tubing overlying the lower mediastinum is present, likely
 mediastinal drains and chest tubes.  A right IJ sheath is present, tip over
 distal SVC.  
 
 There are sternotomy wires and a prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 consistent with recent surgery.  There is vascular plethora and increased
 interstitial markings, consistent with CHF.  Hazy opacity in the left lung
 most likely represents a layering effusion.  Probable left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 suggests a small right-sided effusion.  Plaque-like density along the right
 hemidiaphragm, better seen on the prior film, could reflect some pleural
 calcification, raising the question of prior asbestos exposure.  Clips at the
 right thoracic inlet and an additional small radiopacity over the trachea at
 the thoracic inlet are again noted, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post mediastinal surgery with expected postoperative changes.
 
 2.  Interstitial edema, large left and possible small right 
 effusions, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation on the left.
 
 3.  No pneumothorax identified.  
 
 4. Compared with ___ at 23:20 p.m., layering effusion on the left is more
 pronounced.  The aortic knob calcifications are less apparent, possibly due to
 differences in positioning.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 5. Possible calcified right base pleural plaques -- is there a history of
 asbestos exposure?

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A pacemaker/AICD generator overlies the left
 chest wall.  The leads appear intact and in standard position within the right
 atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.  There are diffuse bilateral
 opacities with perihilar indistinctness and cardiac enlargement, findings
 compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.  Evaluation for pleural effusion is
 limited due to the overlying pacer generator and the single portable view,
 though a small right pleural effusion is noted.  No confluent consolidation is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Moderate congestive heart failure and small right pleural effusion. Assessment

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction, inserted via a right subclavian approach.  The heart is
 mild-to-moderately enlarged with a globular configuration.  The aortic arch is
 calcified.  The aortopulmonary window is slightly prominent suggesting
 possible enlargement of the main pulmonary artery.  Central pulmonary arteries
 are also mildly enlarged.  There is an asymmetric left paramedian opacity with
 upward tenting, perhaps a form of scarring.  Bilateral perihilar fullness
 suggests mild superimposed pulmonary congestion, however.  A moderate
 left-sided pleural effusion is also noted.  Associated parenchymal opacity is
 suspected, probably attributable to associated atelectasis, although
 infectious etiology is not entirely excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate left-sided pleural effusion.  Cardiomegaly and prominent
 central pulmonary vascularity and suspected congestion.  Asymmetric left
 perihilar opacification with a relatively straight edge, possibly due to
 scarring and congestion; correlation with prior radiographs is suggested as
 well as clinical history.

 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  There is stable mild
 elevation of the right hemi-diaphragm of uncertain significance.  Soft tissue
 fullness in the right hilar region is felt most likely to reflect prominent
 vascular structures due to marked patient rotation on the current study.
 Asymmetric biapical pleural thickening, left greater than right, likely
 postinflammatory but for which comparison to remote studies would be helpful
 to assess for stability. There are at least three focal pulmonary pulmonary
 opacities seen in both upper lobes and in the left mid lung, the largest of
 which measures approximately 3-4 mm in size. On the left, these opacities are
 likely calcified given their inherent density and as such, this would favor
 prior grand granulomatous infection. However, comparison to remote studies to
 assess for stability would be recommended. If remote studies are not
 available, further imaging with CT should be undertaken. No evidence of
 pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
